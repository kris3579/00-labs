##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I placed styles targeting elements in base.css as well as the imported google fonts, styles targeting ids in layout.css, styles targeting classes or decendant selectors in modules.css.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did not, it seemed to work perfectly.
